# Sensible

This is a [Sensible](https://sensible.to/) project bootstrapped with [`yarn create sensible-app`](https://github.com/Code-From-Anywhere/sensible/tree/main/packages/create-sensible-app).

## Getting Started

This project is recommended to be worked on from [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com).

The easiest way to start developing is to run the tasks when opening the folder. This is a setting that has to be activated only once after creating the project. If this is the first time opening this project from VSCode, run the command `Manage automatic tasks in folder` and allow it. After restarting the editor your project will be ran.

**TL;DR:**

1. `Cmd + Shift + P` --> `Manage automatic tasks in folder` --> `Allow Automatic Tasks In Folder`. 
2. `Cmd + Shift + P` --> `Developer: Reload Window`
3. Profit
